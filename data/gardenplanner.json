Varieties with light-coloured seeds usually have the best flavor. ",
      "harvesting": "When you see birds pecking at your amaranth, or when seeds fall away from the cluster when gently rubbed, it is time to harvest your crop. When the weather is dry, bend over seed heads into a large bucket and clip them off.
